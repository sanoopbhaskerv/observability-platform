# Observability Platform — OTel Collector Golden Path Config
#
# This is the org-standard "collector-pack" reference configuration.
# Deploy this alongside your services as a sidecar or DaemonSet.
#
# Architecture:
#   App (OTLP) → Collector Sidecar → Backend (Grafana/Tempo/Mimir/Loki)
#
# The Collector provides the second layer of defense (defense in depth):
# - Tail sampling (keep errors + slow traces, sample baseline)
# - Noise filtering (drop health checks, actuator endpoints)
# - Attribute normalization (enforce resource attributes)
# - PII scrubbing (redact known patterns)
